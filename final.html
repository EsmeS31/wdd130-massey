        <h1>YOU'VE BEEN PHISHED! (But It’s Cool — You’re Safe)</h1>

        <p>
            What Just Happened?

        You just gave your personal information to a fake cruise line named Scamliner.

        There is no free cruise. There never was. This was a simulated phishing experience

        meant to show how easy it is to get tricked online. If you’re feeling a little called out — that’s the point. This is a safe place to

        fail and learn.
        </p>

        <p>
            What is Phishing?

        Phishing is when a scammer impersonates a trustworthy entity to steal your personal data.

        They use fake emails, websites, text messages, and even phone calls to trick you into

        giving up:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Passwords</li>
            <li>Credit card numbers</li>
            <li>Social Security numbers</li>
            <li>Your dignity</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Protect Yourself in the Wild</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Verify the sender before clicking links.</li>
            <li>Look at the domain name — is it off by one letter? That’s a trick.</li>
            <li>Don’t enter personal info on random forms or popups.</li>
            <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere you can.</li>
            <li>Use strong, unique passwords with a password manager.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Would You Fall for It Again? (Quick Checklist)</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Did you click something too fast?</li>
            <li>Did the promise of a reward cloud your judgment?</li>
            <li>Did you give up sensitive info without verifying the source?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you said “yes” to any of those — you're human. But now you're a *smarter* human.</p>

        <h2>Everyday Anti-Phishing Best Practices</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Don’t trust urgency — scammers love to rush you.</li>
            <li>Pause and verify before you click anything.</li>
            <li>Update passwords regularly.</li>
            <li>Keep your browser and antivirus tools updated.</li>
            <li>Hover over links to see where they *really* go.</li>
        </ul>
